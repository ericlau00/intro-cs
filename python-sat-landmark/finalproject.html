	<h1> NYC Landmarks & SAT Scores </h1> 
	<h3> Ahmed Sultan and Eric Lau / Intro to Comp Sci 2 / Konstantinovich pd 4 </h3>
	<h4> Description </h4>
	<div class="list">
	Our website explores the landmarks of New York City. They are divided amoung different classes: individual landmarks, landmarks in historic districts, scenic landmarks, and interior landmarks. We've created multiple breakdowns of the data including a table to show the number of landmarks per borough, a randomizer that displays preselected landmarks and a line graph to show change in the number of landmarks over the past 50 years. <br> <br> Although we mainly focused on viewing the subdata sets for the landmarks, we also correlated the presence of landmarks to SAT performance in the area of the landmarks by creating a pair of maps that shows the location of landmarks and the performance of schools in the SAT divided by borough or school districts.
